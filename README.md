# ARDemo
This's a simple Augmented Reality Demo using Xamarin Forms and MvvmCross. Was shown in my talk about Augmented Reality with Xamarin Forms in the Xamarin Assemble 2019 celebrated on Argentina.

It show a way  to use a PageRenderer in each platform for initialize and use ARCore and ARkit. Sure, there're many ways of doing this, this's just one.

Provider "as it is", let me know if you find any issues with it or if you have any ideas on how to improve the demo
